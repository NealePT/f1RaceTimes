# f1RaceTimes

This is a project I created to keep track of Formula 1 event times so I wouldn't have to check the F1 website several times every race week to make sure I don't miss anything. I created it as a Mac menu bar app for both the convenience of being able to click it from anywhere on my computer as well as wanting to check out the new MenuBarExtra feature of MacOS 13+.
